00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.919
most experienced players

try and unsettle him i don't know about

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.090
runs

9
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.910
[Music]

10
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.000
[Applause]

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.199

12
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:25.599
off

13
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.640
wade's left hand just couldn't grip it

14
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.199
it's a great effort goes for that over

15
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.360
mid-on

16
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.440
opening up now india first six of the

17
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.760
morning

18
00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.800
pulled in played it on exactly what

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.160
australia needed

20
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.879
and it's pat cummins again and it's

21
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.960
rouhani the captain just looking to

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.719
maybe advance the scoreboard a little

23
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.879
bit more in the last few hours this time

24
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.320
he looks delayed

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.079
sort of cut one that was too close to

26
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.559
the body

27
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.239
it's more aggressive from pajaro moves

28
00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.600
his feet punches it away

29
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.560
and picks up his first boundary

30
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.560
that's nicely cut two from pajaro

31
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:27.840
two boundaries in three deliveries

32
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.759
you will see that everywhere what an

33
00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.720
effort by

34
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.240
jay hazelwood that is absolutely

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.880
outstanding let alone from any fielder

36
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.640
but let alone your big fast ball it's in

37
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.680
the middle of a spell

38
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.320
he was on his knees he got it in one

39
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.000
motion on his knees

40
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.280
through the ball and that's how

41
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.620
that is absolutely brilliant

42
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.600
[Applause]

43
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.920
that's a good shot it's a fraction sure

44
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.960
but he's been good enough

45
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.399
got quick hands rashad punt

46
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.160
that's through the offside he's not

47
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
happy with himself nathan lyon

48
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.060
a much needed boundary for india though

49
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.920
[Applause]

50
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.000
tim very excited

51
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.760
you can see no hot spot appearing on the

52
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.319
glove

53
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.080
and i've got no spike

54
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.519
on sneaker the australians

55
00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.519
will not believe that

56
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.400
he's gone for that the man out the deep

57
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.239
bishop hunt's not taking any of that

58
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.840
slash tie and wide it's the way he plays

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.959
oh we taking one on the body is it

60
00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.000
maybe the arm just wondering whether it

61
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.200
got him under that elbow

62
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.840
it's a grid run out hazel would yeah

63
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:18.239
his slowest 50 in test history

64
00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.280
and it means a lot to josh hazelwood an

65
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.080
important partnership breaker nice

66
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.000

[Applause]

69
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040
so one thing he hasn't been he's stuck

70
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.400
on the crease he's either gone forward

71
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.959
or back

72
00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.720
a little bit of extra bounce from pat

73
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.040
cummins maybe the effort ball

74
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560
but the changing field has done the

75
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.319
trick and cummins he has been

76
00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.550
magnificent today

77
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.729
[Music]

78
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.120
nicely caressed by ashwin to get off the

79
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.879
mark

80
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.230
and he'll fetch four for it as well

81
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.280
[Applause]

82
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.120

that's an easy single easy single yeah

85
00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.160
straight to him well it doesn't get any

86
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.240
better than that in terms of planning

87
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.040
one move one ball and straight in the

88
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040
bread basket

89
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800
to jadaisia who's been starved to the

90
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.400
strike

91
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.720
he cuts it away nicely pekovsky will

92
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.840
have to give that one away

93
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.400
[Applause]

94
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.800
looks like the third run out another

95
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.479
direct hit

96
00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.479
that's insane we were just saying about

97
00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.520
how well

98
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.759
the australians have fielded and the big

99
00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.759
quicks this time it's minus lavish

100
00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.340
stepped up

101
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.510
[Applause]

102
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840
gee that's nicely played that's his

103
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.360
first battery and test cricket as well

104
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.080
he'll enjoy that

105
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.720
hold onto your hats here jadaisia takes

106
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.080
on the short ball from stark

107
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.560
oh gee that's a good short ball so

108
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.320
there's a concern with jadaja

109
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.479
the other concern will be rishabh hahn

110
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.080
pulled hard from jadaja it's a beautiful

111
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.520
qriket shot

112
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.759
little tickle on that one paddy cummings

113
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.000
ends up with four for 29.

114
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.400
india they trail on the first innings by

115
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.039
94.

116
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.919
takes it on and takes it on nicely would

117
00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.100
be the opening boundary

118
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.079
[Applause]

119
00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.639
beautiful shot from pokowski off the

120
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.270
back foot it'll be a boundary

121
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.930
[Music]

122
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.459
[Applause]

123
00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.080
has to go and india get the vital

124
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.680
[Applause]

125
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.479
it's breakthrough driven by warner

126
00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.290
doesn't take off at his usual speed

127
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.400
[Applause]

128
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.479
well that's wide and manus is not going

129
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.000
to let that pass him by

130
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.600
ah that's help yourself stuff you can't

131
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.039
bowl that on this type of pitch we're

132
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.000
just talking about it

133
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.840
that might be an issue that long stride

134
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.280
to defend against the spinner

135
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.039
sweeping to be an issue

136
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.479
well you'd imagine warren will go

137
00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:47.759
upstairs and does

138
00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.520
impact is in line and wickets is

139
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.120
unpassed call

140
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.960
great start from ashwin can he be the

that's nice put away nicely

143
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.360
yeah that's through the gap it wasn't

144
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.880
much of a gap it was probably a couple

145
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.530
of meters

146
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.039
[Applause]

147
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.400
smith advances throws his hands at it

148
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.319
didn't get all of it but got enough of

149
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:18.400
it

150
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.280

151
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.860
absolutely beautiful

152
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.420
