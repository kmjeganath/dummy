00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.600
in this video I'll discuss intelligent agents understanding intelligent

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.700
agents are an important part of understanding the field

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.600
of AI so what are they well the definition

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.700
of an intelligent agent is any entity that lives

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.600
in an environment and uses sensors to build a

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.700
percept or uses actuators to interact with the environment

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.600
that will that make sound pretty intimidating be short

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.800
definition is a bit friendlier and intelligent Asian is

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
anything that waits for some sort of external stimulus

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.800
and input and then acts upon the stimulus and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.500
put this diagram describes the basic functionality of intelligent

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.900
agent so let's try to understand what it describes

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.500
the term perception refers to an agent's current perception

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.900
of the environment using sensors for example it can

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.500
measure the state of the environment sensors can be

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.300
anything that measure something so a bimetallic strip in

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.200
a thermostat a barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.100
Sonic sensor touch sensor proximity sensor the sniffer sensor

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
you name it now there countless kinds of sensors

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.200
used in countless day today avocations and each one

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.700
has a common feature it measures something often in

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.500
a digital manner that means they can be trained

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
to attack of State in an environment detecting of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100
audio levels increase past a certain number of decibels

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.900
for example

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000
the agent then acts based on triggered events turning

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.300
down the volume to an acceptable level to use

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.600
my basic example and it is a base example

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.800
agents can have multiple actions often sequences they have

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.400
to actuate but more than that perception have a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.900
store sequence that is an agent's percept history every

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.800
Audio Level ever recorded by that perceptive example that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.000
means that a percept could be used to train

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800
a system how to act over time based on

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
that history learned in other words

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200
and that leads to rational agents as the name

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.000
indicates rational agents are agents that act rashly doing

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.300
the right thing by taking actions to maximize performance

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.100
operate more efficiently overtime as a storm or data

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.600
in their histories but how do we tell the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.600
agent what the right thing to do is well

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.000
we use performance measures agents perform actions based on

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.700
their perception those actions create an end-state turn down

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.900
the volume keep in mind that we focus on

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.000
the state of the environment not the agent because

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.600
it's the environments State that's important we don't want

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.500
the agent deciding how good a job is doing

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.000
so the agent can be used to determine how

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.900
desirable that Penn State is is the volume at

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.300
an acceptable level D Performance measures capture those determinations

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.500
used to Graton agent on how well it's done

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.000
and the more time that is past the more

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.800
information can be used to generate performance measures meaning

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.700
that agents can get better over time by virtue

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.100
of their

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200
learned behavior
